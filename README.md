# Bayesian estimate of Probit coefficients 
##### _Last update of scripts: December 2019 (late upload on GitHub)_

Implementation of a Metropolis Hasting and a Gibbs Sampler with auxiliary variables to sample from the posterior distribution of the coefficients of a probit model for a binary response variable, as proposed in Albert, J. H., & Chib, S. (1993).
The model is implemented both with conjugate and with flat priors.


## Tutorial
The module has three functions
* `mh_norm` performs Metropolis-Hastings iterations
* `gibbs_sampler` performs Gibbs Sampling iterations
* `gibbs_sampler_shortchains` performs Gibbs Sampling with an alternative implementation (the chain restart at the initial value after a given number of iterations)



When called, each of the functions produces a simulated sample from the posterior, and returns a trace plot centered around the true value of the parameter.
